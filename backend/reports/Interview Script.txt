### **Interview Script: Adople AI & SKYGEN**

**Interviewer:** Aymen from Adople AI
**Prospect:** Steven J. Berryman, CEO of SKYGEN

#### **Introduction**

**Aymen:** "Hi Mr. Berryman, this is Aymen from Adople AI. I know you have a packed schedule, so I appreciate you taking a moment. How are you today?"

#### **Personalized Hook**

**Aymen:** "I’ve been following SKYGEN for a while, and I was particularly impressed by your career path—moving from Chief Legal Officer to CEO gives you such a unique perspective on both strategic growth and risk management. I also read through your recent Pulse 2026 Report. It's a fantastic piece of industry analysis, and it got me thinking about how SKYGEN communicates that level of expertise more broadly."

#### **Situation Questions**

**Aymen:** "I'm curious, with powerful assets like the Pulse Report, what is your team's current process for creating and distributing that kind of thought leadership? How do you typically leverage that content to reinforce SKYGEN's position as a 'technology-first innovator' in the market?"

**Aymen:** "And how does that strategy extend to your social media channels, particularly LinkedIn, when it comes to engaging with your key audience of payers, providers, and state agencies?"

#### **Problem Questions**

**Aymen:** "I can imagine that with your team focused on developing sophisticated SaaS solutions and managing complex benefits administration, finding the time and resources to consistently produce expert-level content can be a significant challenge. Do you find it difficult to maintain consistent online visibility and thought leadership in between major announcements like the MetLife partnership?"

**Aymen:** "I also took a look at your YouTube channel. You have some excellent high-level brand videos, but I noticed the engagement is quite low. Is there any concern that a less active digital presence might not fully reflect the cutting-edge, innovative nature of your technology platform to potential clients?"

#### **Implication Questions**

**Aymen:** "Thinking about that from a strategic level, if a potential client is searching for solutions to benefits administration challenges and finds a steady stream of educational content from your competitors, what do you see as the potential impact on SKYGEN's sales pipeline and market share?"

**Aymen:** "And from your unique vantage point, having managed both risk and growth, what do you see as the long-term risk to SKYGEN's market leadership if your digital voice doesn't consistently match the power and sophistication of your technology?"

#### **Need-Payoff Questions**

**Aymen:** "Let's imagine a different scenario. If you could implement an AI-driven system that consistently generated SEO-optimized thought leadership—turning your team's core insights into a steady stream of expert articles and targeted LinkedIn posts—how would that help you achieve your strategic growth objectives without draining your team's resources?"

**Aymen:** "What would it mean for your sales team if they were supported by a consistent flow of organic traffic and high-quality inbound leads, all driven by content that positions SKYGEN as the definitive industry expert?"

#### **Closing**

**Aymen:** "Mr. Berryman, I believe Adople AI can bridge that exact gap between your powerful technology and your digital presence. We specialize in creating authentic, expert-level content at scale, ensuring your voice as an innovator is heard consistently and effectively."

**Aymen:** "Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week? I can show you exactly how our AI platform could transform an asset like the Pulse Report into a full quarter's worth of strategic content designed to drive engagement and generate leads."
