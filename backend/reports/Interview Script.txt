### **Interview Script: Adople AI & SKYGEN**

**Interviewer:** Aymen from Adople AI
**Prospect:** Steven J. Berryman, CEO of SKYGEN

---

**Introduction**

**Aymen:** "Hi Mr. Berryman, this is Aymen from Adople AI. I know you have a packed schedule, so I appreciate you taking a moment. How are you today?"

**Personalized Hook**

**Aymen:** "I've been following SKYGEN's work, and as a fellow tech enthusiast, I was particularly impressed with the depth of your 'Pulse Report.' It’s clear you're positioning the company as a true thought leader in the benefits administration space, and it really caught my attention."

**Situation Questions**

**Aymen:** "As the CEO driving SKYGEN’s position as a technology-first innovator, I'm curious—what role does your owned media, like the company blog and LinkedIn, currently play in communicating that strategic vision to potential enterprise clients? And for a high-value asset like the Pulse Report, could you briefly describe your current process for planning and creating that kind of thought leadership content?"

**Problem Questions**

**Aymen:** "That makes sense. I can imagine that with a team focused on complex B2B sales, it must be a challenge. How difficult has it been to maintain a consistent publishing schedule that keeps SKYGEN top-of-mind, especially between major industry events like the NADP conference? And when you invest so much into creating a cornerstone piece like the Pulse Report, what difficulties do you face in repurposing that content across different channels to really maximize its reach and lifespan?"

**Implication Questions**

**Aymen:** "Thinking about that inconsistency, what is the potential impact on your sales pipeline when there are long gaps between blog posts, especially in competitive verticals you're targeting like Medicare Advantage? And if the digital narrative doesn't consistently reflect the innovation happening within your platform, what risk does that pose to your positioning as a 'technology-first' leader against more traditional competitors?"

**Need-Payoff Questions**

**Aymen:** "This is exactly where we focus. Let's imagine a different scenario. If you could automate the creation of high-ranking, SEO-optimized blog content for each of your business verticals—dental, vision, and government—how would that help you achieve your market leadership goals? And if you could save significant time for your internal team on content creation while simultaneously increasing your online visibility, what would that allow your team to focus on instead?"

**Closing**

**Aymen:** "Mr. Berryman, I believe Adople AI's platform is perfectly designed to solve these exact challenges—ensuring your digital presence consistently reflects the cutting-edge technology leader that SKYGEN is. Our AI can help you create and schedule tailored content across all your verticals, turning your owned media into a predictable lead generation engine. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to explore how we can help you achieve this?"
