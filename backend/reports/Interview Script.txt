### **Interview Script: Adople AI for SKYGEN**

**Salesperson:** [Your Name]
**Prospect:** Steven J. Berryman, CEO of SKYGEN

---

#### **Introduction**

**You:** "Hi Mr. Berryman, this is [Your Name] from Adople AI. I know you have a demanding schedule, so I'll be brief. How are you today?"

#### **Personalized Hook**

**You:** "I was just reading the recent market report that named SKYGEN a **key company** in the healthcare data monetization sector—congratulations on that significant recognition. It’s a powerful validation of your team's leadership and innovation in the space."

#### **Situation Questions**

**You:** "I'm curious, with that kind of third-party validation, how are you currently leveraging it in your digital content strategy to attract new enterprise clients?"

**You:** "I also noticed your blog content often aligns with major company milestones like the annual Pulse Report. Could you briefly describe your current process for planning and scheduling this content throughout the year?"

#### **Problem Questions**

**You:** "That makes sense. Given that event-driven approach, do you ever find it challenging to maintain a consistent publishing cadence that builds SEO authority and keeps your audience regularly engaged between those big announcements?"

**You:** "And with a highly specialized audience in the dental and vision benefits sector, how do you ensure your content is not only relevant but also consistently optimized to rank for the niche keywords your prospects are searching for?"

**You:** "I can imagine your team is focused on core business functions. Roughly how much of their time is currently dedicated to the hands-on work of creating and scheduling content for your blog and social channels each month?"

#### **Implication Questions**

**You:** "When the content schedule is inconsistent, what impact might that have on your ability to capture top search rankings for key industry terms, potentially ceding valuable organic traffic to competitors?"

**You:** "I also saw that your YouTube channel has been dormant for a while. Is there any concern that potential enterprise clients researching SKYGEN might perceive a gap between your brand's positioning as a tech innovator and your digital presence?"

**You:** "And thinking about high-value assets like the Pulse Report, what's the potential downstream effect on lead generation if that report isn't repurposed into a series of targeted blog posts that can attract prospects looking for specific data-driven insights?"

#### **Need-Payoff Questions**

**You:** "This is where we see a lot of opportunity. If you could implement an AI-driven system that consistently produces SEO-optimized, audience-centric blog content, how would that help you solidify SKYGEN's position as the definitive thought leader in specialty benefits administration?"

**You:** "And how valuable would it be to automate the scheduling of tailored social media content, freeing up your team to focus on higher-level strategy and direct client engagement instead of manual execution?"

**You:** "Ultimately, if you could turn your digital presence into a powerful, automated lead generation engine, what would achieving that allow you to invest in next to drive further growth for SKYGEN?"

#### **Closing**

**You:** "Mr. Berryman, based on what you've shared, I'm confident that Adople AI's platform is perfectly suited to address these challenges—from automating content creation to ensuring it's always on-brand and optimized for your niche audience. We help tech leaders like you turn their expertise into a consistent, lead-generating asset.
